.. _what-it-does:

What does it do?
----------------

The extension "|extension_name|" generates a sitemap (XML file) with google standards for your website.

What problem does it solve?
---------------------------

This extension is designed because of a need to have a propper sitemap for pages with dynamic content. A lot of other extensions (ie. tt_news, news) are using a detail page to render the content based on parameters. Other sitemap extensions would insert only the detail page in to the sitemap or need a special configuration. 
This extension does not need any configuration for dynamic pages.
This extension handles multidomain and multilingual sites without any problems. 

Who is interested in this?
--------------------------

If you need a sitemap.xml for your website.
Or if you are using an extension that is using a detail page and parameters to render individual content and you would like all items to be insert into the sitemap, than this is the extension for you.
